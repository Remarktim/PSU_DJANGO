# DJANGO & FAKER

## Project Context

- Django Web Application: You will build a web application using the Django framework to serve as a product catalog. Django will handle the server-side logic, routing, database interactions, and templating for rendering the user interface.

- Data Models: Django's ORM will be used to define data models for products, categories, and any other necessary entities, such as reviews or ratings. These models will act as the blueprint for the database tables.

- Admin Interface: Django comes with a built-in admin interface, which you will configure to allow easy management and maintenance of products, categories, and other entities.

- User Interface: Django's templating engine will be used to create user-friendly views for displaying the product catalog, including category listings, product details, search functionality, and other necessary pages.

- Faker Integration: The Faker library will be integrated into the Django project to generate realistic-looking sample data for products, categories, descriptions, prices, and other relevant details. This sample data will be used for testing and development purposes before launching the actual product catalog.

- Data Generation Scripts: You will develop scripts or management commands that leverage Faker to generate a large volume of sample data for products, categories, and other entities.
